=== Eclipse Build Platform Configuration

Now we need to configure Eclipse so that it knows about UOMo and where it lives so it can build against it.

NOTE: The default behavour of Eclipse when building plug-ins is to build against "itself"; that is to use the currently running plug-ins of the IDE as the build target.
