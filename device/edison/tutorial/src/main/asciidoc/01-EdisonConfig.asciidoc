=== Edison Configuration

This contains a nice intro on the Edison board http://www.codefoster.com/edison-setup/

The following Instructable explains how to set up WIFI on the Edison board and prepare WinSCP http://www.instructables.com/id/Intel-Edison-UpdatingWiFi-and-WinSCP/ 

NOTE: Disk space on the Edison board is roughly around 500 MB. It may be increased by using memory not allocated by default. Which will make installing and running some solutions easier without immediate lack of disk space.
